How to run the Jupyter files:

1. Install Miniconda (Minimal Anaconda distribution of python) from:  https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
* Ananconda does not install packages blindly like pip does. It checks the package to
  be installed against available packages and if there is a conflict, it
  stops. For proper analysis, we need to maintain integrity of environments
  and conda makes it easy.

 * Conda is also super useful for making docker images, i.e. for making
   installable packages, particularly for python projects

2. Get the conda_requirements.yml file attached with this package

3. conda env create -f conda_requirements.yml

4. Now run 
   > jupyter notebook

from commandline or however jupyter is supposed to be run from you machine
